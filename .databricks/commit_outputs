# .databricks/commit_outputs file is used to control whether a notebook's output should be included when committing changes to git.
# Outputs are included/excluded at a per notebook level; committing select outputs within a specific notebook is not feasible.

# Reference:
# Each line in .databricks/commit_outputs represents a glob pattern
# Line starting with # represents a comment
# A notebook that matches a glob pattern will have output included
# A line starting with ! represents an exclusion pattern (i.e. !folder/A/** will exclude output for all notebooks in folder A)
# If a notebook matches multiple glob patterns, the last matching glob pattern will be used
# Note that glob patterns are case sensitive
# More examples can be found here: https://docs.databricks.com/repos/setup.html#patterns-for-repo-config-file

# Uncomment the following pattern to include output for all notebooks
